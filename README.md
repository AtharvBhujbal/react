# Learning React

Welcome to my React learning journey! This repository showcases my progress and projects as I learn React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.


## Resources

These are some of the resources I have found helpful:

- [React Official Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [FreeCodeCamp React Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/react/)
- [React Tutorial by Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gQeDH6xYhmO-db2mhoTSrT)

Happy coding!
